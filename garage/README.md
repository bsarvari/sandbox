# Challenge
I parked my car in a garage and left. After returning I'm unable to drive away because others parked such that they 
 blocked my way to exit.

Goal: unblock the path to exit by moving the surrounding cars. 

* The garage has six vertical and six horizontal roads and it's surrounded by a wall. 
* The cars park on the roads and depending on their size they may block 2 or 3 crossroads.
* The cars can move on their road but they cannot turn.
