Vocabulary:
A <goal> is a plan to move a car. Attribute 'c' is the car id and attribute 'to' holds the target position.
Attribute 'met' is true if the goal is achievable. In such a case the car gets moved to the target position.

The initial garage state is represented by the below matrix where
* x marks empty cells
* digits mark cars. E.g. '1 1 1' in row #3 means car id #1 parks in that row.
* the goal is to unblock car id #0 (myCar)
* position 1,1 is the upper left cell and position 6,6 is the bottom right cell
* the exit is in position 1,3

x x x x x 3
x x x x x 3
1 1 1 2 x 3
6 6 0 2 x x
5 x 0 2 x x
5 4 4 4 x x
